# TON Library Code Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling

The current implementation has minimal error handling. We recommend:

- Adding try/catch blocks to all public methods
- Creating custom error types for different error scenarios
- Adding proper validation for all inputs
- Providing descriptive error messages

## 2. Improved Documentation

While the code has some JSDoc comments, they're minimal. We recommend:

- Adding comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public methods
- Including @param and @returns tags with type information
- Documenting edge cases and expected behaviors
- Adding examples for common usage patterns

## 3. Code Structure Improvements

- Extract large code blocks into smaller, focused methods
- Move constants like the wallet code base64 to class constants
- Group related functionality into logical sections
- Use TypeScript's nullish coalescing operator (??) where appropriate

## 4. Testing Recommendations

- Ensure 100% test coverage for all methods
- Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
- Create integration tests with actual TON network
- Add performance tests for critical operations

## 5. Security Considerations

- Add input validation for all public methods
- Implement proper error handling to avoid unexpected states
- Consider adding timeout parameters to all network operations
- Document security considerations for integrators

## Implementation Plan

1. Start by enhancing error handling and input validation
2. Improve documentation with comprehensive JSDoc comments
3. Refactor code structure with smaller, focused methods
4. Add comprehensive tests for all functionality
5. Review for security considerations

By implementing these changes, the TON library will become more maintainable, secure, and easier to integrate for developers.
